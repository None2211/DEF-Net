# DEF-Net: Dual Encoder Fusion Transformer Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of our paper "DEF-Net: Dual Encoder Fusion Transformer Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation"
## Dataset
You can download the dataset from the official [ISIC](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/) website.
All datasets are organized and used for training, validation, and testing strictly following the official splits.
## Usage
1. Download datasets
2. Clone the repository, and download the pre-trained model [[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/180JsahYjJkhnHEXbPHpet5BKo9pS7Bm0/view?usp=drive_link)], put them into ./ folder. The details of the training are in train.py file.
3. And then run the codeï¼špython train.py Note that the parameters and paths should be set beforehand
4. Once the training is complete, you can run the test.py to test your model. Run the code : python test.py


## Quick Inference
